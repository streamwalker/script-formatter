            <Pre>{`-30 years after the Battle of Endor.

- In the years since:

- A new republic is declared to replace the Galactic Empire. Mon Mothma is named leader of the Republic.
- Palpatine and the 1st Galactic Empire, as ruthless as it was, kept the galaxy in order. Because of that, a lot of rival organizations were held in check by Vader. Many of these factions start to spring up to grasp control of different territories of the galaxy.
- In those battles with one of the more powerful factions, Mon Mothma takes her place. In this battle, Han and his crew sacrifice themselves to save Coruscant from a doomsday device. There was no other way.
- Wracked with guilt over not being able to save his friend, Luke Skywalker disappears. He believed that if he had not been a failure to live up to his full potential, he might have been able to save everyone.
- Luke believes that the true balance of the Force lies in being able to manipulate the total Force, the light side and the dark.
- Luke, many years ago, decided to resist the temptation of the dark side, and he was also able to master the light on his own after the death of his master, Yoda. Luke, in his studies, has been able to do things that no Jedi or Sith has ever accomplished. Luke can use his powers to heal wounds; he can move literally anything. He can call lightning down from the sky and control elements of nature. Luke is able to read thoughts and see near and far perimeters. And Luke can call forth any spirit from the netherworld, sometimes involuntarily.
- Luke called forth Palpatine's spirit from the netherworld to show him the secrets of the dark side. Apt irony, as Palpatine.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`- After taking down the Jedi Mind and coming to a stalemate with a particularly skilled foe, Luke intervenes and reveals his plans.
- Controlly led Obi-Wan to rescue Xan and take face each other for the first time in years.
- Luke and his Jedi return to Coruscant with Leia and Xan.
- They return to Luke's temple on New Alderaan. Luke reveals to Xan that he has been watching her for a while to assess her potential. It is revealed that Leia is, in fact, her mother. This comes after Luke shows Xan that she has the potential to balance the Force, something none of his pupils have ever been able to fully manage (return to Dagobah).
- Xan is intrigued by the potential of her own abilities. It is the insecurity she carries that has always held her back.
- Luke starts to tell Xan one evening that he has discovered what has the potential of completely destroying the New Republic's already fragile support.
- Luke offers Xan the chance to come with him, destroy this new threat, and he will show her the balance of the Force.
- Xan agrees and she, Luke, and R2 head off in the Millennium Falcon while Luke's troops head on to conduct and track the enemy.
- Luke and Xan, in the middle of a training session, are intercepted when Leia and her fleet find the Falcon and board it.
- Luke and Leia now face each other for the first time in years. Luke argues that the power of the Force lies in mastery between the light and the dark. Leia contends that the dark side corrupts absolutely, as she can see in his mind that Luke has had to dispatch some of his Jedi who were overcome by the darkness.
- Xan asks if this is the case, why he didn't fall to that path. Luke explains that he sees in her the same potential that Luke himself has, that she can balance the Force.
- Xan is caught in the middle of her master and mother and her uncle who is letting her chase her full potential. She must choose between the two.
- Leia and Luke join forces to take down the new threat to the Republic.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`On the evening of the fatal Battle where Han and his crew sacrificed their lives for Coruscant, Leia revealed to Lando that she was pregnant and that she never got to tell Han. Lando, in shock and shame that Han had died in his place, vowed to take care of Leia and her child. What was once out of obligation turned into an even more powerful healing force... Love... but years later, what has gone on?

Leia and Lando's friendship is based on mutual respect and a strong bond shared through an epic ordeal and the loss of a best dear friend. Luke left before Leia could share with him that she was having a child. To protect her from Han's many enemies, both inside and outside the Republic, the details of her origins were kept private. When Xan was old enough, the nature of her identity was revealed to her, but not the past. Because of the close kinship between a Rodian and her master, his questions about Xan's mother never came up as most Jedi are orphans.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`Luke and Xan aboard the ship Millennium Falcon: Luke is in a training session with Xan. He is testing the limits of her capabilities. Xan, already a seasoned Jedi Knight for her age, is able to deftly pass and excel in tests using the Force to visualize her surroundings. During the training, using the same training helmet Luke once wore for Obi-Wan Kenobi, Xan is able to fend off multiple droids, the loathsome boxes and piles of equipment she deflects with her lightsaber. Then she is distracted by 2 additional droids and Luke's lightsaber flying in the door. While successfully fending off these attacks, Luke Skywalker has to exert his power to stand against the powerfully wrathful barrage. Xan feels all the power and ferocity of a rage-filled assault, but within Luke all she can sense is... calm. Like he is the eye of the center of a storm. Xan is tasked to make deft moves of her own and battle to victory as the Falcon is attacked by a barrage of blasts... warning she shuts down from Valor (Luke's Ship).`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Note 4:</Heading>
            <Pre>{`It is evident that Leia has selected Xan to one day replace her as Master of the Order and the leader of the Republic. Even though Xan has dislocated the role that she has been groomed for since birth, it is apparent that she has ideals and notions that contradict her duty to follow protocol and remain in the box boundaries of her expectations.

Xan may be good, but as she does, she is very hard on her job of Chief of Security, where Leia yearns for peace... Xan hungers for war. She craves drastic action and has the power and skill to back up her bravado. She is the perfect mixture of her mother's strength and her father's grit.

I very much dislike to see Leia, who seems to dispel her borrowings. Xan says: "He only just found me. I have so much to learn and now he is gone. He didn't have to leave; you drove him away and now I hate you both." A Jedi has to constantly keep their emotions in check. Abundance of emotion tends to loss of control... loss of control leads to the dark side. The trick that Xan can become empowered and not be corrupted by the dark side relies on her ability to "become the Force."`}</Pre>
