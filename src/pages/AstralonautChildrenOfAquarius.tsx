During a private discussion between Carter and his son, it becomes apparent that they initiated "Ides of March" attack ahead of whatever the consortium had planned. They are vying for control of the United States. While the Consortium's plan was to assassinate the president and his cabinet and place their own man in the Oval Office, The Burkes executed a massive terror attack to push through a gun control bill into law that would require all Americans to surrender their firearms.

This began a second civil war. (midpoint culmination)`}</Pre>

Carter's friend and greatest adversary, Franco Renault, is the "face" of the consortium.

Randall Reynolds, a reporter-friend Emily has known since college, approaches her and, to her horror, reveals to her that the Burkes are not just a family of wealthy land developers, but by connecting the dots, shows her that they own a sizable interest in the entire planet.

The reporter uses his personal connection to attempt to sway Emily from her husband and convince her to help him gather enough evidence to bring them down.`}</Pre>

She didn't die in 9-11, she ensured the attack's success.

Edmund is able to capture his mother alive and holds her for questioning. She somehow still looks younger than her son.

Theresa is about to reveal why she left him and her father right before Renault's men, surprisingly the same men who attacked the Treasury building, "storm the palace." Edmund is captured and Theresa is assumed dead in the explosion.`}</Pre>

Edmund: ...if she went with you...

Renault: Yes. You are not a Burke. You never were. You are a Renault. Heir to all my lands and titles...all you have to do is say "Yes".

Catholic Priest Alistaire Blaire is on a mission from God to gather the Trinity, the Heralds of Christ. Three humans imbued with the powers and abilities of Jesus Christ in order to confront those who would stand in the way of the second coming, the "Illuminati".

Synopsis:

Three times in our recent history, Christ has returned in the body of a human being. His nature is revealed when the child reaches puberty and miracles begin to occur. Father Blaire, an excommunicated Priest has been on a rogue mission the last 120 years to find and protect the Christ child so that his purpose may be fulfilled but the evil "Illuminati" has always been on step ahead of him with agents in place to kill the child once he emerges..

This time is different.

Father Blaire prayed for a solution and upon him was laid a vision. The Christ Child is not able to protect himself until he reaches maturity. Until that time, his powers will be split amongst three protectors...the Trinity. Along with Father Blaire, the immortal, they will find and protect the Christ child until he has reached maturity and is able to fulfill his destiny.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`Father Blaire is given a vision of three events where the Heralds will be revealed. One is the Rwandan massacre, the result of the civil war between the Hutus and the Tutsi.

The "Illumaniti" created this conflict for their own personal gain.

NOTE:

The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi, was a genocidal mass slaughter of Tutsi in Rwanda by members of the Hutu majority government. An estimated more than 800,000 Rwandans were killed during the 100-day period from April 7 to mid-July 1994, constituting as many as 70% of the Tutsi population. Additionally, 30% of the Pygmy Batwa were killed. The genocide and widespread slaughter of Rwandans ended when the Tutsi-backed and heavily armed Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) led by Paul Kagame took control of the country. An estimated 2,000,000 Rwandans, mostly Hutus, were displaced and became refugees.

            <Pre>{`Father Blaire foresaw The Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe Japan in January 1995 that killed more than 5,500 and injured 26,000 others. The economic loss has been estimated at about $US 200 billion.

The last event Father Blaire forsaw was the terror attack on the World Trade Center.
A female executive is in labor. She and a firefighter are trapped in a room. He dies while telling her to push when a giant beam falls on him.
Alone, fire everywhere, the woman feels that all is lost. Then, Father Blaire is there, suddenly, telling her to push. She does. Two other children are with Father Blaire, one, Ryoko, is holding up rubble and steel telekinetically. The other child, Simon, places his hand on the woman's forehead and she no longer feels any pain.
The child is born and the five of them seem to teleport out before tower falls.

On a rooftop close by, the mother holds her child once, tells him that his name is Peter and that he isn't a mistake. He is a miracle, then she dies.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`Father Blaire and his team raise the children and keep them safe. They train them in the use of their powers and reveal which of Christ's attributes each has an affinity for.

Ryoko (Jamie Chung) is the Head of Christ. She has telekinesis. She is also able to use psychometric abilities to read the history of objects and people to read their past and see their future.
Simon (Michael B Jordan) is the Hand of Christ with the ability to heal others and change the mass, density and chemical composition of matter.
Peter is the Heart of Christ: Peter has super strength, invulnerability, and an iron will. Peter, because he has heart, never quits and never gives up. He is the youngest and therefore the most underestimated.

Marcus, doubting himself, is not sure whether he is Christ or Anti-Christ, all he know is that he needs to do the right thing and save the Priest who saved him.

            <Pre>{`The Christ Child gains the collective knowledge of every world it culls as the life energy passes through him into the beyond. The collective knowledge makes him more powerful with each world he destroys.

NOTE: The Christ child defeats the anti-Christ and takes his powers back from the Trinity. There is a loophole that allows Michael to use the same method to take the power back from the Christ child. For a moment, Michael becomes all-powerful, all-knowing, all-seeing. Michael is walking alongside the Source. He says no born entity should have this much power.

When Michael releases the power, instead of sending it back to the source, he puts it into all living things, and the power becomes knowledge. All beings have the knowledge that they are part of a greater whole. The outpouring of Knowledge like the water of life. And Thus begins, the true age of Aquarius.`}</Pre>

1941: Edmund's dependent, Richard Burke oversees the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, thrusting the US into WWII

9-9-2001: Richard's son, Carter Burke stands opposed to the group in a disagreement over NYC. For the first time since its conception, the consortium is fractured. Carter leaves them with an ominous warning from Shakespeare: "Beware the Ides of March"

9-11-2001: The consortium, sans Burke, executes the worst terrorist attack on US Soil until...

4-15-2020: Seven heavily armed men storm the US Treasury building in DC, killings three hundred people before gaining access to a part of the facility that isn't supposed to exist; a covert control station for a satellite based anti-missile defense system. They launch two missiles: one destroys the treasury building, devastating the surrounding area for several square blocks. The other destroys a nuclear power plant in Washington state, creating a chain reaction that destroys most of Tacoma.`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Act 1 (Sq2)</Heading>
            <Pre>{`Act 1 opens on a extravagant weeding. Carter Burke is celebrating the wedding of his son, Edmund Burke, and Fiancé Emily Rosenberg.

During a private discussion between Carter and his son, it becomes apparent that they initiated "Ides of March" attack ahead of whatever the consortium had planned. They are vying for control of the United States. While the Consortium's plan was to assassinate the president and his cabinet and place their own man in the Oval Office, The Burkes executed a massive terror attack to push through a gun control bill into law that would require all Americans to surrender their firearms.

This began a second civil war. (midpoint culmination)`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Act 2 (SQ 3 & 4)</Heading>
            <Pre>{`It is revealed that Edmund's mother, Theresa, officially died in the 9/11 attacks in the World Trade Center. This was a cover-up. Unofficially, she was meant to stop the attack on NY But died in the process.

Carter's friend and greatest adversary, Franco Renault, is the "face" of the consortium.

Randall Reynolds, a reporter-friend Emily has known since college, approaches her and, to her horror, reveals to her that the Burkes are not just a family of wealthy land developers, but by connecting the dots, shows her that they own a sizable interest in the entire planet.

The reporter uses his personal connection to attempt to sway Emily from her husband and convince her to help him gather enough evidence to bring them down.`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Act 2 (SQ 5 & 6)</Heading>
            <Pre>{`During a civil war 2 related conflict at the midpoint, Carter Burke dies...by the hand of Theresa Burke! Who was not only alive all these years, but faked her death when Carter split from the consortium because, unlike Carter, Theresa was a "true believer". She didn't die in 9-11, she ensured the attack's success.

Edmund is able to capture his mother alive and holds her for questioning. She somehow still looks younger than her son.

Theresa is about to reveal why she left him and her father right before Renault's men, surprisingly the same men who attacked the Treasury building, "storm the palace." Edmund is captured and Theresa is assumed dead in the explosion.`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Act 3 (SQ 7 & 8)</Heading>
            <Pre>{`On Renault's private cargo plane, he tries to sway Edmund to his side by disclosing the darkest revelation yet.

Renault: Do you know why your mother chose to stay with the consortium?

Edmund: ....

Renault: Did she tell you the truth about your father?

Edmund: She told me enough, Franco. She told me YOU killed him.

Renault: No, Edmund. "I" am you father.

Edmund: No! That isn't true! That's impossible!

Renault: She had no choice, really. Had Carter learned the truth, he would have surely killed you both. I promised, after the schism, that I would not allow you, or Carter to be harmed...

Edmund: ...if she went with you...

Renault: Yes. You are not a Burke. You never were. You are a Renault. Heir to all my lands and titles...all you have to do is say "Yes".

- Edmund, with his entire world shattered, jumps off the plane.

- Emily kills the man holding her, grabs a parachute, and follows her husband into the void.`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Epilogue</Heading>
            <Pre>{`It is revealed that Emily is pregnant, with Edmund's child; Franco's grandchild and his legacy.

It also turns out that Randall Reynolds is really Randall Renault. Just as Carter had his son's wife picked out from high school, unbeknownst to Edmund, Franco, as soon as he has learned of Carter's pick, set Randall upon her.

"Go get my grandchild back" he says to Randall.

"Yes, Father." is Randall's reply.

            <Pre>{`Hi-Concept

I wish to adapt my graphic novel into an animated series for Nexflix or Amazon.

Trinity:

An excommunicated priest must find and gather three children who have been imbued with the powers of Christ to herald the second coming by finding the Christ child and protecting it from the evil Illuminati.

Catholic Priest Alistaire Blaire is on a mission from God to gather the Trinity, the Heralds of Christ. Three humans imbued with the powers and abilities of Jesus Christ in order to confront those who would stand in the way of the second coming, the "Illuminati".

Synopsis:

Three times in our recent history, Christ has returned in the body of a human being. His nature is revealed when the child reaches puberty and the miracles begin to occur. Father Blaire, an excommunicated Priest has been on a rogue mission the last 120 years to find and protect the Christ child so that his purpose maybe fulfilled but the evil "Illuminati" has always been on step ahead of him with agents in place to kill the child once it's identity is revealed.

This time is different.

Father Blaire prayed for a solution and a solution was presented. The Christ Child is not able to protect himself until he reaches maturity. Until that time, his powers will be split amongst three protectors...the Trinity. Along with Father Blaire, the immortal, they will find and protect the Christ child until he has reached maturity and is able to fulfill his destiny.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`Father Blaire is given a vision of three events where the Heralds will be revealed. One is the Rwandan massacre, the result of the civil war between the Hutus and the Tutsi.

The "Illumaniti" created this conflict for their own personal gain.

NOTE:

The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi, was a genocidal mass slaughter of Tutsi in Rwanda by members of the Hutu majority government. An estimated more than 800,000 Rwandans were killed during the 100-day period from April 7 to mid-July 1994, constituting as many as 70% of the Tutsi population. Additionally, 30% of the Pygmy Batwa were killed. The genocide and widespread slaughter of Rwandans ended when the Tutsi-backed and heavily armed Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) led by Paul Kagame took control of the country. An estimated 2,000,000 Rwandans, mostly Hutus, were displaced and became refugees.

END NOTE:

Synopsis continued:

Father Blaire foresaw The Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe Japan in January 1995 that killed more than 5,500 and injured 26,000 others. The economic loss has been estimated at about $US 200 billion.

The last event Father Blaire forsaw was the terror attack on the World Trade Center.`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Screenwriting Framework Note</Heading>
            <Pre>{`NOTE: "A movie, I think, is really only four or five moments between two people; the rest of it exists to give those moments their impact and resonance. The script exists for that. Everything does." - Robert Towne

When breaking down a film's structure, generally speaking, "The Eight Sequences" framework is the standard: two in Act One, four in Act Two, and two in Act Three.

But the number 8 is only part of the equation. If the sequences are what shape a screenplay's three-act structure, then the five major plot points are the building blocks behind sequence construction: Inciting Incident, Lock In, Midpoint, Main Culmination, and Third Act Twist.`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Power Assignment Note</Heading>
            <Pre>{`NOTE: In this version, the power assignments differ from earlier drafts:

• Michael is the Heart of Christ with the ability to heal others and change the mass, density and chemical composition of matter.
• Simon is the Hand of Christ: Simon has super strength, invulnerability, and an iron will. Simon, because he has heart, never quits and never gives up.

In the September 2019 draft (Page 5), the assignments are reversed: Simon is the Hand (healing) and Michael's Gift is resurrection. This discrepancy reflects the evolving nature of the story across drafts.`}</Pre>

Father Blaire explains that their child is indeed special, but not in the way they think. She was taken by an alien race called the Draconians. These Aliens are part of a larger scheme to halt or delay the second coming.

"second coming?" Max says with a puzzled look on his face.

"He's talking about Christ" Shana says as we then focus on the cross around her neck, denoting that she is, indeed, a woman of some faith.

"You're telling me that our daughter is Jesus Christ", max says

"Jesus was the last known conduit to reach maturity, but, yes, Samantha is the Christ Child and we have to find the ship she is on before the Draconians find a way to harness her power and use it to their own ends..."

"And just how are we supposed to track down an alien spacecraft...it not like the entire planet hasn't been looking since the Roswell crash..." shana says

"Yeah, their not know to register their intergalactic plates with the DMV" Max says

Come with me. End this."

            <Heading>Episode 1: "The Sky is Falling"</Heading>
            <Pre>{`Cold Open:
A charter plane is caught in heavy turbulence. Inside, Paul Anderson and his wife, Theresa Anderson, struggle to control the aircraft while their young sons, Adam and Jonathan, remain strapped in their seats.

Suddenly, a flash of light fills the cabin. Outside, alien craft appear, pacing the plane and surrounding it. Grey extraterrestrials materialize inside the cockpit, stating that they have come for Paul. They claim he has a bounty on his head, placed by Emperor Raysun, who seeks vengeance against his former captor.

Revelation: Years ago, Paul Anderson was involved in a top-secret SAP (Special Access Program) tasked with retrieving alien spacecraft. During one such mission, Raysun, then a young Nerrian warrior, crashed on Earth while being pursued by another alien faction.

Present Day:
Adam dreams of Raysun, haunted by visions of the alien ruler. Years later, his mother reaches out to him telepathically from across the galaxy, revealing that his brother Jonathan is alive.

            <Heading>Episode 3: "The Angel's Burden"</Heading>
            <Pre>{`Barrington Cartwright becomes Blaire's third student.

A Life of Duality:
Barrington lives in two worlds—one as a privileged high-society heir, the other as a hybrid outcast. He hides his abilities from his bigoted boarding school friends, fearing rejection.

Finding Perspective:
Seeing Mackenzie's work with Adam, Barrington asks for a way to control his powers, which allow him to change the properties of physical matter. Mackenzie engineers a device to help him stabilize the transformation process, but it is classmate Colby Rush who shifts Barrington's outlook.

"I wish we could trade," Colby admits. "These big feet for those hands."

The comment forces Barrington to reconsider his self-loathing—perhaps his abilities are a gift, not a burden.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`Colby Rush joins as the fourth student.

Grief and Psychic Horror:
Samantha is haunted by the death of her closest friend, a tragedy worsened by an accidental telepathic link she formed as the friend was dying.

However, her abilities extend beyond simple telepathy. Samantha can move objects with her mind and communicate across vast distances. But she has also been speaking to interdimensional entities—beings that even Blaire cannot perceive. She talks to The Source, the Vanier, Eternity, Chaos and Order, the In-Betweener, and Kinslayer.

Blaire's Revelation:
Mackenzie develops a helmet that allows Blaire to tune into Samantha's unique psionic frequency. When he dons the device, he finally sees the cosmic beings Samantha has been communicating with.

They turn and look at him.

Blaire, realizing they have now become aware of him, rips the helmet off in sheer terror.`}</Pre>

            <Heading>Episode 6: "The Kidnapping"</Heading>

Raysun's Revenge:
Raysun has brought the young Children of Aquarius to Helotia, the capital of the Nerrian Galaxy, seeking revenge on Paul Anderson by making his son suffer.

The Imperial Guard:
The students find themselves facing seasoned Nerrian warriors—the Emperor's elite enforcers. Outclassed and outmatched, they must learn to work together to escape.

Adam's Tragic Discovery:
During the chaos, Adam learns that his mother died years ago—she stole a Nerrian ship and launched a suicidal assault on Raysun's stronghold in an attempt to kill him.`}</Pre>

However, one of his companions possessed a device that could locate their closest genetic relative—a tool meant to guide lost travelers home.

The Time Displacement Incident:
Upon reaching Earth, they discovered that 3,000 years had passed due to an error in their method of space travel.

Adam's closest relative? Jonathan Anderson.

Adam and his father later theorize that Jonathan isn't just a distant descendant—he is likely Adam's own son, transported into the far future as a baby.

Escape and Divine Intervention:
With no means to return home, Samantha seeks help from her "friends."

Albion, a Vanier, intervenes, transporting the Children of Aquarius from the Nerrian Galaxy back to Earth via singularity.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`The Children of Aquarius return home just in time to witness Blaire preparing for war.

The 7 seals are the 7 nuclear powers. The Christ child means to trigger them all.
The Christ child says "they forged the sword of their own annihilation."
Adam: Nuclear…

Blaire's Response:
Determined to rescue his students, Blaire has gathered a team of experienced hybrids to launch a counteroffensive into space.

His new team consists of:
• Shadow – a being who can slip in and out of shadows
• Able Wright – a tactical genius capable of analyzing any opponent's weakness and exploiting it
• Simon Olatunji – a powerhouse with super strength and near-invulnerability
• Ryoko Tsurayaba – a fierce telekinetic warrior

As Blaire and his new recruits prepare to depart for Helotia, the original team returns, battered and forever changed.
