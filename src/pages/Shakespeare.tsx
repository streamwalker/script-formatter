                <Pre>{`Shakespeare wrote in Early Modern English — not Old English, not Middle English. Most of his vocabulary is still in use; the challenge is unfamiliar grammar.

Key patterns:
• Thou / Thee — informal "you" (subject / object). "Thou art" = you are.
• Thy / Thine — your / yours. "Give me thy hand."
• Verb endings — -est (2nd person: "thou knowest"), -eth (3rd person: "he hath").
• Inverted syntax — verb before subject for emphasis: "Speaks he the truth?" instead of "Does he speak the truth?"
• Double negatives — intensify rather than cancel: "I will not budge for no man's pleasure."

Once you internalise these patterns, 90 % of Shakespeare opens up.`}</Pre>

                How to Parse Iambic Pentameter Line by Line
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <Pre>{`Iambic pentameter is the heartbeat of Shakespeare's verse: five pairs of syllables per line, each pair going da-DUM (unstressed-stressed).

Example — Romeo and Juliet (II.ii):
  "But SOFT, what LIGHT through YON-der WIN-dow BREAKS?"
   da  DUM   da   DUM     da  DUM  da   DUM  da  DUM

Steps:
1. Count syllables — aim for 10.
2. Mark the natural stresses of each word.
3. See where Shakespeare matches or breaks the pattern.
4. Breaks are intentional — a stressed first syllable ("BREAKS") can signal urgency.

Tip: Don't force a mechanical beat. The tension between natural speech rhythm and the underlying meter is what makes the verse alive.`}</Pre>

                <Pre>{`1. Read it aloud — always. Shakespeare wrote for the ear, not the page.

2. Follow the punctuation, NOT the line breaks.
   A line ending without punctuation means the thought continues — don't pause there.

3. If a sentence runs across three lines, read it as one flowing thought.

4. Emphasise antithesis (opposites placed side by side):
   "To BE or NOT to be" — the contrast carries the meaning.

5. Look for lists and build them:
   "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow" — each repetition adds weight.

6. Don't worry about understanding every word on the first pass. Get the shape of the speech; meaning follows.`}</Pre>

                What Is Iambic Pentameter?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <Pre>{`Iambic pentameter = five iambs per line.
An iamb = one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable (da-DUM).

  da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM
  "Shall I | com-PARE | thee TO | a SUM | mer's DAY?"

Five beats. Ten syllables. That's it.

Why this meter? It's the closest English gets to natural speech rhythm. We say "a-BOUT," "be-LIEVE," "to-DAY" — all iambs. Shakespeare just lined them up.

Variations to learn:
• Trochee (DUM-da) — inverts the first foot for impact: "ONCE more | un-TO | the BREACH"
• Feminine ending — an extra unstressed syllable at the end: "To BE | or NOT | to BE | that IS | the QUES-tion" (11 syllables)
• Caesura — a pause mid-line, often marked by punctuation: "To die, | to sleep — | no more"`}</Pre>

Structure:
  Quatrain 1 (lines 1–4)   — ABAB — introduce the subject
  Quatrain 2 (lines 5–8)   — CDCD — develop or complicate
  Quatrain 3 (lines 9–12)  — EFEF — twist or deepen
  Couplet (lines 13–14)     — GG   — resolve, surprise, or subvert

Example — Sonnet 18:

  Thou art more lovely and more temperate.    B
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, A
  And summer's lease hath all too short a date. B

5. Personification — giving human traits to abstract ideas:
   "Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath."

• The Globe Theatre (1599) — open-air, 3,000 capacity. Groundlings stood in the pit for a penny.
• No sets — language had to paint the scene ("But look, the morn in russet mantle clad…").
• No lighting — afternoon performances. Night scenes were acted in broad daylight.
• All-male casts — boys played women. This adds layers to comedies where women disguise as men (Viola, Rosalind).
• The audience talked, ate, threw things. Plays had to grab attention fast.

Shakespeare was a shareholder in his company (the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later the King's Men). He wrote for specific actors and a specific space — always practical, never merely literary.`}</Pre>

Reading tips:
• Read stage directions carefully — they reveal action Shakespeare trusted to the actors.
• Soliloquies are the character thinking aloud TO the audience. They're invitations into a mind.
• Prose vs. verse — lower-class characters often speak prose; nobles speak verse. When a noble drops into prose, something has shifted.
• Watch a performance first, then read. Or: read a scene, then watch it performed. The two experiences feed each other.`}</Pre>

              <AccordionContent>
                <Pre>{`The line is a unit of breath. Shakespeare gives you roughly one thought per line, and the line length matches a comfortable breath.

Rules of thumb:
1. Breathe at the end of a line ONLY if there's punctuation.
2. If there's no punctuation (enjambment), carry the thought into the next line without pausing.
3. Stress the operative words — usually the ones that carry new information.
4. Let the meter support you, not constrain you. It's a rhythm beneath the speech, like a bass line.

Exercise: Take any speech. Mark the end-stops (lines ending with punctuation) and enjambments. Read it aloud, breathing only at end-stops. Notice how the pace changes.`}</Pre>

              <AccordionContent>
                <Pre>{`Shakespeare embedded stage directions in the verse itself:

• Short lines (fewer than 10 syllables) — indicate a pause, a moment of silence, or a shared line with another character. Something happens in that gap.

• Shared lines — when two characters complete one line of pentameter between them, the cue is rapid: no pause. The second speaker picks up instantly.
  JULIET: "Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow—"
  ROMEO: "—That I shall say good night till it be morrow."

• Prose vs. verse shifts — if a character who normally speaks verse suddenly drops into prose, they may be mad (Hamlet), drunk (Cassio), or speaking to someone of lower status.

• Repeated words — when a character repeats a word, they're stuck on it emotionally.
  "Never, never, never, never, never." — Lear, holding Cordelia's body.

• Lists that build — Shakespeare piles images when a character is overwhelmed:

2. Chunk by punctuation. Each sentence is a beat. Master one beat before moving to the next.

3. Write it out by hand — studies show handwriting improves retention.

4. Speak it in your own words first, then translate back to Shakespeare's. This ensures you know the meaning.

5. Rehearse with movement — walk, gesture, sit, stand. The body remembers what the mind forgets.

6. Record yourself and listen back. You'll catch rhythms you miss when reading silently.

7. Run the speech at triple speed — gabble it. Then slow down to performance pace. This frees you from over-thinking individual words.
