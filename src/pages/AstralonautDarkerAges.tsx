            <Pre>{`In a time before our time lived a powerful sorcerer named Corbin Rothchylde, who, along with his wife Estelle, ruled the entire eastern quadrant of Draconion. In a time of unending war amongst the five kingdoms for control of the land, Corbin's kingdom thrived due to his immense power. So much so that none dared invade his territory.

However, a great change came when a dark cult of religious radicals known as the Writhers began to descend upon all five kingdoms. Their sinister mission was to slaughter all who possess magical ability, the only people truly powerful enough to challenge them. Their leader, a dark priest and mystic known only as The Heretic, possessed a demonic power that was virtually indomitable.

When the writhers came for Corbin and Estelle, a massive battle ensued, during which Estelle was mortally wounded. Unable to accept his wife's death, Corbin, in an act of desperation, cast a temporal rift spell to freeze Estelle's body in a state of temporal stasis while he searched for a way to revive her. The temporal rift spell was exceedingly rare and extraordinarily dangerous.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`But for a sorcerer of Corbin Rothchylde's power, it was child's play. However, as powerful as Corbin was, the temporal rift was volatile and the spell had to be maintained in perpetuity. Corbin placed Estelle in a temporal rift sphere in a secret location away from the Writher onslaught and set out to find a way to bring her back. In order to keep the temporal rift from collapsing, Corbin had to expend an extraordinary amount of power. Combined with the energy needed to stay alive and continue his search, his power was being drained at an alarming rate. The temporal rift spell would not fail as long as the caster was alive. Therefore, the longer Corbin remained alive, the more his power diminished.

Centuries passed and Corbin's search for a cure proved fruitless. However, he did discover the existence of a realm of supernatural power known as the nexus of souls. In this place, it was said that anything was possible. Corbin, now a feeble old man living under an assumed name in 1982 England, began searching for the nexus. For decades, Corbin lived alone, using what remained of his power to stay alive and power the temporal rift spell that kept Estelle frozen in stasis.`}</Pre>

Rothchylde had told them that the nexus was within the ancient catacombs beneath the ruins of his former kingdom. Once they cross through the threshold, they encounter a mystical guardian who tells them that once they enter the nexus, they cannot return to their reality. Instead, they will be transported to a world of the nexus' choosing. Maven must decide if she is willing to leave her reality and her uncle behind in order to save the world from the temporal rift collapse.

Maven decides to enter the nexus. Shinobu decides to go with her but Titus stays behind. The guardian tells Maven that the nexus has the power to seal the rift, but she must sacrifice something of great value. Maven offers her magical ability. The nexus accepts and the rift is sealed. Maven and Shinobu are transported to a new world — a strange land unlike anything they've ever seen. They have no idea where they are. The final panel reveals they are in the world of Battlefield: Atlantis, 35,000 years in the past.`}</Pre>

Maven is gifted with an innate magical ability that she keeps hidden for fear of the Writhers. One night, a strange object falls from the sky and crashes in the forest near the village. Maven investigates and discovers what appears to be some kind of escape pod.

Inside the pod, Maven finds an old journal belonging to Corbin Rothchylde. The journal details Rothchylde's search for the nexus of souls and contains a map to its supposed location. Before Maven can process what she's found, the Writhers attack the village. Maven's uncle fights them off and tells Maven to run. Maven watches from the tree line as her uncle is taken by the Writhers.

Maven, now alone, decides to follow the map in Rothchylde's journal to find the nexus of souls, believing it may hold the power to save her uncle and stop the Writhers.`}</Pre>

Titus, once a celebrated knight, abandoned his post during a Writher attack, an act of cowardice that haunts him. He is sentenced to the fighting pits — a gladiatorial arena where criminals fight for their freedom.

Titus survives several rounds in the pits, each fight revealing more of his formidable combat skills. During his final bout, a Writher raid on the capital causes chaos. In the confusion, Titus escapes the pits. As he flees the city, he notices something strange — his body is beginning to change. His skin hardens, his senses sharpen. Titus is transforming into something inhuman.

Terrified and confused, Titus flees into the wilderness, unsure of what he is becoming.`}</Pre>

Shinobu possesses a rare form of magic — the ability to see and communicate with the spirits of the dead. Her master has kept this ability secret, training Shinobu in the art of concealment.

One day, Shinobu's master is visited by a group of Writhers posing as travelers seeking healing. Shinobu senses their true nature but her master, unaware, welcomes them. The Writhers reveal themselves and kill Shinobu's master. Shinobu barely escapes, using her spirit sight to navigate through the spirit realm and emerge miles away.

As she catches her breath, Shinobu sees a massive fireball streak across the sky — the same object that Maven witnessed crash in the forest. She decides to follow it, sensing that it holds some significance.`}</Pre>

As they make camp that night, they are attacked by a group of wraiths — spectral creatures that serve the Writhers. Maven uses his hidden magical ability to fight them off while Shinobu uses her spirit sight to locate the wraiths' anchor — a cursed totem hidden nearby. Together, they destroy the totem and the wraiths dissipate.

This battle forges a bond between Maven and Shinobu. Maven shares what he found in Rothchylde's journal and his quest to find the nexus of souls. Shinobu, having lost her master and with nowhere else to go, decides to join him.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`The best stories are not about the events that happen, but about the people they happen to. Character is story. If the audience doesn't care about your character, they won't care about your plot.

The moral premise of a story is the lesson the protagonist learns. It is the theme expressed through action. A good moral premise has two parts:

1. The psychological conflict — what the character believes vs. what is true
2. The physical conflict — the external obstacles that force the character to confront their false belief

Example: Maven believes she must hide her power to be safe. The truth is that her power is the only thing that can save the people she loves. The physical conflict (the Writhers taking her uncle, the quest for the nexus) forces Maven to use her power openly, thus learning the moral premise.

Every scene should serve the moral premise. If a scene doesn't challenge the character's false belief or advance the physical conflict, it should be cut.

The antagonist should embody the opposite of the moral premise — what happens when someone fully commits to the false belief. The Heretic hides behind religious dogma to justify destroying those with power, when in truth, he fears what he cannot control.`}</Pre>

Logline formula: On the verge of [a life-changing event], a [flawed protagonist] must [do something difficult] before [a deadline], or else [dire consequences].

Example: On the verge of losing her only family, a young woman hiding magical powers must journey to a mythical realm before the world tears itself apart, or else the people she loves will be consumed by an unstoppable darkness.

5. The protagonist's greatest strength should also be their greatest weakness. Maven's magic makes her powerful, but her fear of it makes her vulnerable.

6. The antagonist must believe they are the hero of their own story. The Heretic believes he is saving the world from the chaos of unchecked power.

7. Supporting characters should each represent a different response to the central dilemma. Shinobu runs from connection. Titus runs from responsibility. Corbin clings to what he's lost.

8. Character change must be earned through suffering. The audience should feel that the character's transformation was inevitable given what they endured.

9. The final choice must cost the protagonist something real. Maven gives up her magic — the very thing that defined her — to save a world that feared people like her.`}</Pre>

            <Pre>{`Time Traveler: Estelle is actually from the future — specifically the year 2027 (or 2037).

Pre-Travel Life: In her original time, she was a thief and party girl who frequented nightclubs and used magic for "Jedi mind tricks" to pick pockets. Her lover was a man named Christian.

The Journey: An old woman (potentially an older Estelle) gave her an artifact to travel back in time to an age where natural energy was abundant.

Rise to Power: Estelle and Christian traveled back to the "Dark Ages". Their powers grew enormous, and they were worshipped as gods, ruling side-by-side.

The Turning Point: Christian trained mages but eventually died. Following his death, Estelle slaughtered the survivors and became cold and emotionless.`}</Pre>

Hidden Identity: A midwife told Estelle the baby died, using a spell to make the child appear fallen. The baby was sent away to be trained to take her mother's place as ruler.

Upbringing: The plan to train her was foiled when she was lost and found by "Brother Billy". She was raised by adopted parents.

Deception: "Sister Agatha" would visit Maven and tell her lies about her mother, claiming the Dark Queen betrayed and killed her "real" mother to steal her power.`}</Pre>
